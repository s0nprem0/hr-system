<!-- TODOs: implement these features across client and server
TODO: Add tests for core features (auth, employees, departments, payroll) using React Testing Library and unit/integration tests for client flows.
TODO: Add CI workflow (GitHub Actions) to run TypeScript checks, linting, and tests for server and client.
TODO: Add audit log UI to view payroll/salary changes; ensure only authorized roles can access and map API audit endpoints.
TODO: Ensure role-based UI gating: hide/disable controls based on user role in `AuthContext`.
TODO: Harden refresh token handling and global unauthorized flow; listen for `auth:unauthorized` and log out cleanly.
TODO: Implement multipart file upload UI and client-side validation for profile photos and documents.
TODO: Add reporting UI for payroll exports (CSV/Excel) and hooks to call server export endpoints.
TODO: Add shared TypeScript API types to a common package/folder to avoid type drift between client and server.
