<!-- TODOs: implement these features across server and client
TODO: Add tests for core features (auth, employees, departments, payroll) using Jest and add integration tests for login/refresh flows.
TODO: Add CI workflow (GitHub Actions) to run TypeScript checks, linting, and tests for server and client.
TODO: Add audit log API endpoints and admin UI to review payroll/salary changes; ensure only authorized roles can access.
TODO: Add a `/health` endpoint and basic metrics (uptime, DB connection) for monitoring and container readiness.
TODO: Harden refresh token handling and global unauthorized flow; ensure the client logs out cleanly when refresh fails.
TODO: Implement multipart file upload support for profile photos and documents with validation and storage (local or S3-compatible).
TODO: Implement reporting/export endpoints (CSV/Excel) for payroll summaries and add UI to generate exports.
TODO: Add shared TypeScript API types to a common package/folder to avoid type drift between client and server.
